 # sort-visualizer
Small sort visualizer to see how some of the sort algorithms work using QT GUI and some threads


![GUI](https://github.com/TonceaAlin/sort-visualizer/blob/main/gif.gif)

 ## Purpose

This is a good way to learn how sort algorithms work and how they efficient they are.

Based on the comparisons we can understand their complexity.

 ## More features to be done:
* Add more unusual sort algorithms like cocktail-sort or gnome-sort
* Allow user to change the amount of tales and maybe the speed
* Display informations about the complexity for each of the algorithms
